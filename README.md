# Sample Setup Using Parcel for a p5 Sketch that uses ES Classes

Install dependencies with `npm i`
Run with a local server with `npm start`
Build a version to host with `npm run build`

Uses [parceljs](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling. Also relies on the ESNext field declarations proposal for some syntactic sugar which allows you to declare `setup` `draw` etc as properties on the class.
